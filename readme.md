   - All project files and history are stored in a single central repository. Developers check out files, make changes, and commit them back.  
   - **Examples**: SVN (Apache Subversion), Perforce.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Simple to set up and understand.  
     - Centralized control provides clear oversight.  
   - **Disadvantages**:  
     - A single point of failure—if the central server goes down, all work halts.  
     - Limited offline capabilities.  

2. **Distributed VCS (DVCS)**:  
   - Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its full history, enabling work even without a network connection.  
   - **Examples**: Git, Mercurial.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Enables offline work and faster operations for local tasks.  
     - Better support for branching and merging.  
   - **Disadvantages**:  
     - More complex to learn and manage.  

---

### **2. Techniques for Managing Source Code**  
- Effective source code management ensures smooth collaboration, prevents conflicts, and maintains code quality.

#### **Branching**  
- Branching allows developers to create independent versions of the codebase for specific tasks.  
- **Common Branch Types**:  
  1. **Feature Branch**: Used for developing a specific feature.  
  2. **Hotfix Branch**: Created for urgent bug fixes in the production environment.  
  3. **Release Branch**: Stabilized branch for preparing code for deployment.  
  4. **Main Branch (Master/Trunk)**: The stable version of the code ready for production.

#### **Merging**  
- Combines changes from different branches into one.  
- **Merge Strategies**:  
  1. **Fast-Forward Merge**: Adds changes directly if no other commits exist.  
  2. **Recursive Merge**: Creates a new merge commit when multiple changes are made in different branches.  
  3. **Rebase**: Reapplies changes from one branch onto another, creating a cleaner commit history.

#### **Commit Practices**  
- Commit frequently with clear, meaningful messages.  
- Keep commits small and focused to simplify troubleshooting and rollback.  
- Avoid committing large, unrelated changes in a single commit.

---

## Seven testing principles

1. **Testing Shows the Presence of Defects**:Testing can only find defects that are present; it cannot prove that there are no defects in the system.

2. **Exhaustive Testing is Not Possible**: It’s not feasible to test all possible inputs and scenarios due to time and resource constraints, so testing must be focused on the most critical areas.

3. **Early Testing**: Testing should start as early as possible in the software development lifecycle, ideally during the requirement or design phase, to identify defects early and reduce cost.

4. **Defect Clustering**: A small number of modules or components often contain the majority of defects. Focus testing on these areas can lead to more effective defect discovery.

5. **Pesticide Paradox**: Repeating the same set of tests will eventually stop finding new defects. To uncover more issues, tests need to be continuously reviewed and modified.

6. **Testing is Context-Dependent**: The approach to testing depends on the context of the software, such as its size, complexity, usage, and criticality. There’s no one-size-fits-all strategy.

7. **Absence of Errors Fallacy**: Just because no defects are found in testing doesn’t mean the software is right. It could still fail to meet user requirements or expectations, which is a more critical issue.


## Testing Levels

### **1. Unit Testing**  
- Focuses on testing individual components or units of the software in isolation.  
- Performed by developers to ensure each unit functions correctly.

### **2. Integration Testing**  
- Tests the interactions between different units or modules.  
- Ensures that components work together as expected.

### **3. System Testing**  
- Tests the entire software system after integration.  
- Validates that the system meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

### **4. Acceptance Testing**  
- Determines if the software meets the acceptance criteria defined by stakeholders.  
  - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: End-users test the software to ensure it meets their needs.  
  - **Business Acceptance Testing (BAT)**: Business representatives verify the software meets business requirements.

<img src="./images/15-TestingLevels.png" style="width:100%;border-radius:25px;" />


## Software Testing Process

### **1. Test Planning**  
- Define the scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for testing.  
- Identify the testing types, techniques, and methodologies.

### **2. Test Design**  
- Create test cases and scenarios based on requirements.  
- Prepare test data and environments.

### **3. Test Execution**

## **2. The TDD Cycle**
### **Phases of TDD**
1. **Red Phase**:  
   - Write a failing test for a specific functionality that does not yet exist.  
   - Ensures the test captures the desired behavior of the system.
2. **Green Phase**:  
   - Implement the minimal amount of code required to pass the test.  
   - Focus is on functionality rather than code quality.
3. **Refactor Phase**:  
   - Improve the code’s structure, design, and efficiency without altering its behavior.  
   - Ensures the code remains clean, modular, and maintainable.

---

Here’s a simplified version of the **TDD Workflow and Principles**:

---

### **TDD Workflow and Principles*  
1. **Write a Test (Red)**: Write a test for a feature that doesn’t exist yet.  
2. **Run the Test (Red)**: Run the test and confirm it fails because the feature isn’t implemented.  
3. **Write the Code (Green)**: Write just enough code to pass the test. Focus on making the test pass, not on code quality.  
4. **Run All Tests (Green)**: Run all tests to ensure the new code doesn’t break anything else.  
5. **Refactor (Refactor)**: Improve code quality, design, and efficiency without changing its behavior.  
6. **Repeat (Red-Green-Refactor)**: Repeat for the next feature, going through the cycle again.

---


## **3. Advantages of TDD**
1. **Improved Code Quality**: Enforces disciplined development and ensures requirements are met.  
2. **Early Defect Detection**: Identifies bugs early in the development process, preventing cascading issues.  
3. **Quick Feedback Loop**: Provides rapid feedback on the correctness of the code.  
4. **Better Design**: Encourages modular and decoupled code design.  
5. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Refactoring ensures long-term maintainability without breaking functionality.  
6. **Regression Testing**: The test suite ensures existing features remain functional after changes.  
7. **Collaboration**: Promotes better communication and understanding among team members.  

---

## **4. Applications of TDD**
