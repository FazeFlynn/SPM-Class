     - Ensures the logic and data flows work as expected.  
  2. **Black Box Testing**:  
     - Examines external functionalities without knowledge of internal code.  
     - Input-output validation is the primary focus.  
  3. **Gray Box Testing**:  
     - Combines both white box and black box techniques.  
     - Tests the system with some knowledge of its internals for broader coverage.

### **Automation Testing**
- Uses tools or scripts to execute test cases and validate software.  
- **Common Automation Tests**:
  1. **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components for correctness.  
  2. **Integration Testing**: Ensures modules work together seamlessly.  
  3. **System Testing**: Validates the entire system against requirements.  
  4. **Acceptance Testing**: Determines if the software is ready for deployment.  
  5. **Regression Testing**: Confirms new changes do not break existing functionality.  
  6. **Performance Testing**: Assesses speed, scalability, and responsiveness.  
  7. **Security Testing**: Detects vulnerabilities and potential threats.

# Lecture 16

Here are the structured and concise notes for **Unit-3, Lecture 16** on **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**

---

## **1. Introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD)**  
- **Definition**: TDD is a software development methodology where tests are written before the actual implementation of the code.  
- **Key Principle**: Follows an iterative cycle of *Red-Green-Refactor* to ensure functionality, quality, and maintainability.


<img src="./images/16-TDD.png" style="width:90%" />

---

## **2. The TDD Cycle**
### **Phases of TDD**
1. **Red Phase**:  
   - Write a failing test for a specific functionality that does not yet exist.  
   - Ensures the test captures the desired behavior of the system.
2. **Green Phase**:  
   - Implement the minimal amount of code required to pass the test.  
   - Focus is on functionality rather than code quality.
3. **Refactor Phase**:  
   - Improve the code’s structure, design, and efficiency without altering its behavior.  
   - Ensures the code remains clean, modular, and maintainable.

---

## **3. Advantages of TDD**
1. **Improved Code Quality**: Enforces disciplined development and ensures requirements are met.  
2. **Early Defect Detection**: Identifies bugs early in the development process, preventing cascading issues.  
3. **Quick Feedback Loop**: Provides rapid feedback on the correctness of the code.  
4. **Better Design**: Encourages modular and decoupled code design.  
5. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Refactoring ensures long-term maintainability without breaking functionality.  
6. **Regression Testing**: The test suite ensures existing features remain functional after changes.  
7. **Collaboration**: Promotes better communication and understanding among team members.  

---

## **4. Applications of TDD**
1. **Unit Testing**: Verifies individual components in isolation.  
2. **Integration Testing**: Validates interactions between system modules.  
3. **System Testing**: Confirms the software meets specified requirements.  
4. **Acceptance Testing**: Aligns functionality with user requirements and business goals.

---

## **5. TDD Frameworks**

1. **JUnit (Java)**: Supports annotations and parameterized tests for Java development.  
2. **NUnit (.NET)**: Provides attributes and assertions for C# and VB.NET projects.  
3. **Jest (JavaScript)**: Used for Node.js and React with built-in mocking capabilities.  
4. **RSpec (Ruby)**: Employs a readable syntax for behavior-driven development.  
5. **Pytest (Python)**: Features auto-discovery and fixtures for Python projects.

---

## **6. Setting Up a TDD Environment**
1. **Install Framework**: Use language-specific package managers (e.g., npm, pip, NuGet).  
2. **Organize Project Structure**: Separate production and test code.  
3. **Write Tests**: Begin with the *Red-Green-Refactor* cycle.  
4. **Run Tests**: Verify that tests pass or fail appropriately after changes.  
5. **Refactor and Repeat**: Continuously refine the code while maintaining test success.

---

## **7. TDD in Practice**

# Lecture 17

Here are the structured and concise notes for **Unit-3, Lecture 17** on **Software Development Methodologies**:

---

## **1. Software Life Cycle Model (SDLC)**
- **Definition**: A software lifecycle model (or process model) represents the stages and methods required to develop and maintain a software product. It includes the structure and steps that guide the software from inception to completion.
  
### **Need for SDLC**
- Ensures a systematic and disciplined approach to software development. Without it, teams risk chaos and project failure.  
- Provides clear guidelines on when and what tasks to perform to avoid confusion.

---

## **2. SDLC Models**
### **Waterfall Model**
- **Description**: A traditional, linear, and sequential approach to software development. Each phase is completed before moving to the next.

<img src="./images/17-WaterFall.png" style="width:90%" />

  
  **Phases**:
  1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis**: Collect and document all requirements.
  2. **System Design**: Design the system architecture and components.
  3. **Implementation**: Develop the system based on the design.
  4. **Testing**: Ensure the system meets requirements.
  5. **Deployment and Maintenance**: Deploy the system and provide ongoing support.

  **Advantages**:
  - Clear phases with defined deliverables.
  - Well-suited for small projects with stable requirements.

  **Disadvantages**:
  - Rigid, hard to incorporate changes once a phase is completed.
  - Long development cycles, especially for complex projects.

---

### **Agile Model**
- **Description**: An iterative and incremental approach emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Agile focuses on delivering functional software in small increments rather than waiting for the final product.

<img src="./images/17-Agile.png" style="width:90%" />


  **Principles**:
  1. Customer satisfaction through continuous delivery of valuable software.
  2. Embrace changing requirements throughout development.
  3. Deliver working software frequently.
  4. Encourage close collaboration between developers and stakeholders.
  5. Build projects around motivated individuals.

  **Popular Agile Frameworks**:

  - **Kanban**: A visual method for managing tasks and work in progress.
  - **Lean**: Emphasizes efficiency and reducing waste in development.

  **Advantages**:
  - Highly flexible and adaptive.
  - Continuous customer feedback and delivery of functional software.
  
  **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires significant collaboration and communication.
  - Less formal documentation can be a challenge for large-scale projects.

---

### **Spiral Model**
- **Description**: A risk-driven, iterative approach combining elements of both the Waterfall and Agile models. It focuses on risk management through repeated cycles (spirals) of planning, analysis, design, and evaluation.

  **Phases**:
  1. **Planning**: Define project objectives and constraints.
  2. **Risk Analysis**: Identify and assess risks.
  3. **Engineering**: Design, code, and test the software.
  4. **Evaluation**: Gather feedback from stakeholders.

  **Advantages**:
  - Strong emphasis on risk management.
  - Accommodates changes in requirements.

  **Disadvantages**:
  - Complex and resource-intensive.
  - May lead to extended timelines and higher costs.

---

## **3. Selecting the Appropriate SDLC Model**
- The choice of methodology depends on several factors, including project requirements, team size, complexity, and timeline.
  - **Waterfall**: Best for small projects with well-defined, stable requirements.
  - **Agile**: Ideal for projects with evolving requirements and a need for flexibility.
  - **Spiral**: Suitable for large, complex projects where risk management is crucial.

---

## **4. Factors Influencing Methodology Selection**
1. **Customer Involvement**: Agile and Scrum methodologies benefit from frequent customer feedback and collaboration.
2. **Project Size and Complexity**: For large, complex projects, models like Spiral or Agile provide better flexibility and risk management.
3. **Team Size and Expertise**: Agile methodologies are more suitable for smaller teams that are self-organizing and collaborative.
4. **Time and Budget Constraints**: Waterfall is often used when there are strict timelines and fixed budgets.
