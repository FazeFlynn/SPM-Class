## Lecture 33: Software Configuration Management (SCM)


### **1. Version Control System (VCS)**  
  - A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that tracks and manages changes to files (e.g., source code, documentation) over time.  
  - It enables collaboration among developers, maintains version history, and allows rollback to previous versions if needed.  
  - VCS ensures consistency and traceability, especially in large or distributed teams.

#### **Types of VCS**  
1. **Centralized VCS (CVCS)**:  
   - All project files and history are stored in a single central repository. Developers check out files, make changes, and commit them back.  
   - **Examples**: SVN (Apache Subversion), Perforce.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Simple to set up and understand.  
     - Centralized control provides clear oversight.  
   - **Disadvantages**:  
     - A single point of failure—if the central server goes down, all work halts.  
     - Limited offline capabilities.  

2. **Distributed VCS (DVCS)**:  
   - Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its full history, enabling work even without a network connection.  
   - **Examples**: Git, Mercurial.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Enables offline work and faster operations for local tasks.  
     - Better support for branching and merging.  
   - **Disadvantages**:  
     - More complex to learn and manage.  

---

### **2. Techniques for Managing Source Code**

#### **Branching**  
- Branching allows developers to create independent versions of the codebase for specific tasks.  
- **Common Branch Types**:  
  1. **Feature Branch**: Used for developing a specific feature.  
  2. **Hotfix Branch**: Created for urgent bug fixes in the production environment.  
  3. **Release Branch**: Stabilized branch for preparing code for deployment.  
  4. **Main Branch (Master/Trunk)**: The stable version of the code ready for production.

#### **Merging**  
- Combines changes from different branches into one.  
- **Merge Strategies**:  
  1. **Fast-Forward Merge**: Adds changes directly if no other commits exist.  
  2. **Recursive Merge**: Creates a new merge commit when multiple changes are made in different branches.  
  3. **Rebase**: Reapplies changes from one branch onto another, creating a cleaner commit history.

#### **Commit Practices**  
- Commit frequently with clear, meaningful messages.  
- Keep commits small and focused to simplify troubleshooting and rollback.  
- Avoid committing large, unrelated changes in a single commit.

---

## Lecture 37: Deployment Strategies

### 1. **Traditional Deployment Approaches**

**Traditional Deployment** involves manually releasing software to production in discrete stages, typically through a series of steps involving development, testing, staging, and production environments. This method is often less automated and may involve downtime during the release process.

**Key Steps in Traditional Deployment**:
1. **Development Phase**: Code is written and unit tested by developers.
2. **Testing Phase**: The code is deployed to a testing environment where it undergoes various forms of testing (e.g., system, integration, and user acceptance).
3. **Staging Phase**: After testing, the software is deployed to a staging environment that closely resembles production.
4. **Production Phase**: Finally, the software is deployed to the live production environment, often involving downtime for system updates.

**Drawbacks**:
- **Downtime**: Traditional deployment often involves some downtime, especially when deploying updates or patches.
- **Manual Process**: The process can be time-consuming and prone to human error.
- **Longer Feedback Loops**: Bugs and issues are typically discovered after deployment, which leads to slower fixes.

---

### 2. **A/B Testing Deployment**

**A/B Testing Deployment** is a strategy where two different versions of a software feature (Version A and Version B) are deployed to different user groups in parallel to compare their performance. This allows teams to determine which version performs better in terms of user engagement, conversion rates, or other metrics.

**Steps in A/B Testing**:
1. **Versioning**: Create two different versions of the feature or product, ensuring that only the specific feature being tested differs between the versions.
2. **Random Allocation**: Split users into two groups, where one group sees Version A and the other sees Version B.
3. **Collect Data**: Measure key metrics (e.g., performance, user behavior, clicks) for both versions.
4. **Analysis**: Compare the results to determine which version delivers the better user experience or desired outcome.
5. **Decision**: Based on the results, either implement the better-performing version to all users or iterate on the designs.

**Advantages**:
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Provides empirical evidence on which version works better, reducing guesswork.
- **Reduced Risk**: Changes are tested on a small portion of users, minimizing the risk of wide-scale negative impact.
  
**Example**: A website might test two different layouts of its homepage (A vs. B) to see which one results in higher click-through rates or sales.

---

### 3. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**

**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** are modern software deployment practices that emphasize automation and frequent, incremental releases.

    - Higher software quality.
  - **Example**: Developers commit code to GitHub, which triggers an automated build and test process using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
  - Extends CI by automating the entire deployment process, allowing new code to be automatically pushed to production after passing automated tests.
  - The process includes building, testing, and deploying the software with minimal manual intervention.
  - **Benefits**: 
    - Faster time-to-market.
    - Reduced manual effort in deployments.
    - Frequent updates and bug fixes.
  - **Example**: After successful testing in CI, new code is automatically deployed to production servers using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or AWS CodeDeploy.

**CI/CD Pipeline Steps**:
1. **Code Commit**: Developers commit changes to the version control system.
2. **Build**: The code is compiled, and dependencies are resolved.
3. **Test**: Automated tests are executed to ensure functionality.
4. **Deploy**: After passing tests, the code is deployed to production or staging environments.
5. **Monitor**: Post-deployment monitoring ensures the software is performing as expected.

**Advantages of CI/CD**:

- **Maintenance-specific Metrics**: Metrics specific to software maintenance activities (e.g., MTTR, cost per defect).

---

### 4. **A Common Type of Software Metric**

A **common type of software metric** is the **Defect Density**, which is widely used across various stages of software development and maintenance. It helps assess the quality of the software by tracking the number of defects per unit of code.

**Defect Density**:
- **Formula**: 

$$
\text{Defect Density} = \frac{\text{Number of Defects}}{\text{Size of Software (e.g., lines of code)}}
$$
  
- **Purpose**: To measure the software's defect rate and identify areas that might require more attention or rework.
  
- **Example**: If a software product contains 50 defects in 10,000 lines of code, its defect density would be:

$$
\frac{50}{10000} = 0.005 \text{ defects per line of code}
$$

Defect density can help developers assess the quality of the software and prioritize maintenance efforts to address high-density areas first.

## Seven testing principles

1. **Testing Shows the Presence of Defects**:Testing can only find defects that are present; it cannot prove that there are no defects in the system.

2. **Exhaustive Testing is Not Possible**: It’s not feasible to test all possible inputs and scenarios due to time and resource constraints, so testing must be focused on the most critical areas.

3. **Early Testing**: Testing should start as early as possible in the software development lifecycle, ideally during the requirement or design phase, to identify defects early and reduce cost.

4. **Defect Clustering**: A small number of modules or components often contain the majority of defects. Focus testing on these areas can lead to more effective defect discovery.

5. **Pesticide Paradox**: Repeating the same set of tests will eventually stop finding new defects. To uncover more issues, tests need to be continuously reviewed and modified.

6. **Testing is Context-Dependent**: The approach to testing depends on the context of the software, such as its size, complexity, usage, and criticality. There’s no one-size-fits-all strategy.

7. **Absence of Errors Fallacy**: Just because no defects are found in testing doesn’t mean the software is right. It could still fail to meet user requirements or expectations, which is a more critical issue.


## Testing Levels

### **1. Unit Testing**  
- Focuses on testing individual components or units of the software in isolation.  
- Performed by developers to ensure each unit functions correctly.

### **2. Integration Testing**  
- Tests the interactions between different units or modules.  
- Ensures that components work together as expected.

### **3. System Testing**  
- Tests the entire software system after integration.  
- Validates that the system meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

### **4. Acceptance Testing**  
- Determines if the software meets the acceptance criteria defined by stakeholders.  
  - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: End-users test the software to ensure it meets their needs.  
  - **Business Acceptance Testing (BAT)**: Business representatives verify the software meets business requirements.

<img src="./images/15-TestingLevels.png" style="width:100%;border-radius:25px;" />


## Software Testing Process

### **1. Test Planning**  
- Define the scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for testing.  
- Identify the testing types, techniques, and methodologies.

### **2. Test Design**  
- Create test cases and scenarios based on requirements.  
- Prepare test data and environments.

### **3. Test Execution**  
- Run the test cases and observe the software's behavior to find defects.

### **4. Defect Reporting**  
- Document and report any defects found during testing to the development team.

### **5. Defect Retesting**  
- After defects are fixed, retest to ensure they are resolved.

- **Key Principle**: Follows an iterative cycle of *Red-Green-Refactor* to ensure functionality, quality, and maintainability.


<img src="./images/16-TDD.png" style="width:100%;border-radius:25px;" />

---

## **2. The TDD Cycle**
### **Phases of TDD**
1. **Red Phase**:  
   - Write a failing test for a specific functionality that does not yet exist.  
   - Ensures the test captures the desired behavior of the system.
2. **Green Phase**:  
   - Implement the minimal amount of code required to pass the test.  
   - Focus is on functionality rather than code quality.
3. **Refactor Phase**:  
   - Improve the code’s structure, design, and efficiency without altering its behavior.  
   - Ensures the code remains clean, modular, and maintainable.

---

Here’s a simplified version of the **TDD Workflow and Principles**:

---

### **TDD Workflow and Principles*  
1. **Write a Test (Red)**: Write a test for a feature that doesn’t exist yet.  
2. **Run the Test (Red)**: Run the test and confirm it fails because the feature isn’t implemented.  
3. **Write the Code (Green)**: Write just enough code to pass the test. Focus on making the test pass, not on code quality.  
4. **Run All Tests (Green)**: Run all tests to ensure the new code doesn’t break anything else.  
5. **Refactor (Refactor)**: Improve code quality, design, and efficiency without changing its behavior.  
6. **Repeat (Red-Green-Refactor)**: Repeat for the next feature, going through the cycle again.

---


## **3. Advantages of TDD**
1. **Improved Code Quality**: Enforces disciplined development and ensures requirements are met.  
2. **Early Defect Detection**: Identifies bugs early in the development process, preventing cascading issues.

- **Maintenance:** Smaller modules are easier to maintain and debug.

Techniques for partitioning include functional decomposition, object-oriented analysis, and top-down/bottom-up design approaches.

---

### Abstraction  
Abstraction simplifies complex systems by focusing on essential features while hiding unnecessary details. It helps manage complexity, improve readability, and create reusable and maintainable code.

**Types of Abstraction:**

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods into objects, hiding internal details.
- **Data Abstraction:** Defining data types that hide implementation details.
- **Procedural Abstraction:** Encapsulating operations into reusable functions.
- **Interface Abstraction:** Defining contracts or interfaces that hide internal workings.

**Benefits of Abstraction:**

- **Simplifies Complexity:** Reduces unnecessary details for easier understanding.
- **Promotes Reusability:** Abstracting common functionality into reusable modules.
- **Facilitates Change:** Easier to modify underlying components.
- **Supports Modularity:** Allows for well-defined interfaces between modules.

---

### Modularity  
Modularity divides complex systems into independent, self-contained modules. Each module addresses specific functionality, making systems easier to understand, modify, and extend.

**Benefits of Modularity:**

Achieving modularity involves principles like information hiding, encapsulation, and separation of concerns.

---

### Top-Down and Bottom-Up Strategy  
**Top-Down Strategy:**  
Begins with a high-level design and decomposes the system into smaller, detailed components. Steps include:
1. Identify the system’s overall goals.
2. Decompose into subsystems.
3. Further break down into smaller components.

**Bottom-Up Strategy:**  
Starts with the smallest modules and assembles them into larger subsystems. Steps include:
1. Develop small, simple components.
2. Combine them to form larger systems.
3. Continue building until the complete system is assembled.

Both strategies have their advantages, with top-down focusing on a clear hierarchical structure and bottom-up emphasizing component reuse and early verification.

---

### Coupling and Cohesion  
**Coupling:**  
Describes the level of interdependence between modules. Minimizing coupling results in more modular, maintainable systems.

**Types of Coupling:**

- **No Direct Coupling:** Modules are independent.
